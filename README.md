# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS_3B
Sentiment Analysis with Pre-trained BERT Model (Incomplete)
This Python script appears to be setting up a sentiment analysis task using a pre-trained BERT model from TensorFlow Hub. However, the code is incomplete, and some parts require further exploration.

1. Library Imports

tensorflow for building and running deep learning models.
tensorflow_hub for accessing pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub.
tensorflow_text for text processing functionalities like tokenization.
pandas for data manipulation (loading CSV files, data analysis).
2. Potential Model Installation (Commented Out)

Commented-out lines suggest installing TensorFlow (version 2.0.0 or higher) and upgrading TensorFlow Hub using pip if they are not already installed.
3. Text Data Loading (Incomplete)

The code reads a CSV file named "IMDB Dataset.csv" into a pandas DataFrame named df using pd.read_csv. This data likely contains movie review text and corresponding sentiment labels.
df.head() is potentially used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame to get a glimpse of the data.
4. Sentiment Distribution Analysis

df['sentiment'].value_counts() likely calculates and displays the distribution of sentiment labels in the data. This helps understand the proportion of positive, negative, or neutral reviews.
5. Missing Parts:

The commented section ("### Adding labels") suggests potential code for adding labels, but the implementation is missing.
The script lacks the core parts for using BERT:
Loading a pre-trained BERT model from TensorFlow Hub.
Text preprocessing (tokenization, potentially adding special tokens like padding).
Feeding preprocessed text data to the BERT model for sentiment classification.
Training or fine-tuning the model (if applicable).
Evaluating model performance on sentiment analysis.
Overall, this code snippet provides a basic setup for sentiment analysis using BERT. However, it requires further development to include the essential steps of loading the BERT model, preprocessing text data, performing sentiment classification, and evaluating the model.
